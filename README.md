### Goal
Practice with RESTfull APi, OpenApi-swagger specification, protection by Sanctum, request validation.

### Description
Project "Storage of the categories in DB with manipulation through REST API". 
DB stores a lot of names of category. Remote user can (using API) get registered, login/logout
and manipulate the data:
* see all categories
* see category by id
* create new category
* update category by id
* delete category by id
* delete all the categories

This actions are protected from unauthenticated user. Every request to protected actions(endpoints, routes) is 
checked for bearer token using behind Sanctum.

Specification based on annotations in classes hierarchy. Specification allows: to see input, output interfaces;
to input the data, make request and watch the result.
